## About
This app is like an online shopping site. The customr first selects an item based on the item_id. Then the customer is again prompted for the quantity they want. Based on the quantity they input, the app algorithm checks if that quantity of the specific item is available in stock; then the application will output the total cost of the item if the quantity is in stock and returns "insufficient quantity" if the user input stock quantity is more than the available in the database.
